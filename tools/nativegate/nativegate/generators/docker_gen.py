# --- Base image pin -------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY A DIGEST AND NOT A TAG
#   `python:3.12-slim` is a MUTABLE tag. Docker Hub re-points it at a new image
#   on every patch/security rebuild, so two builds a month apart silently get
#   different interpreters, different libc, different libgfortran — with no
#   record of the change anywhere in the build. For a product whose entire
#   claim is "the re-hosted numerics return the same answers", an unpinned base
#   is a hole straight through the middle of that claim. A digest is immutable:
#   the same digest is byte-identical forever, or the pull fails.
#
#   The digest below is a multi-arch OCI image index, so it still resolves
#   correctly on amd64 and arm64 — pinning does not cost you cross-platform
#   builds.
#
# HOW TO REFRESH IT (deliberately — this is a reviewed change, not a chore)
#   With Docker available:
#       docker pull python:3.12-slim
#       docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' python:3.12-slim
#   Without Docker, straight from the registry HTTP API:
#       TOKEN=$(curl -s "https://auth.docker.io/token\
#?service=registry.docker.io&scope=repository:library/python:pull" \
#         | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['token'])")
#       curl -sI -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
#         -H "Accept: application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json" \
#         https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/python/manifests/3.12-slim \
#         | grep -i docker-content-digest
#   Then update BASE_IMAGE_DIGEST, note the date, rebuild, and re-run the
#   generated service's golden-value tests before shipping the new base.
#
# Resolved 2026-08-22 from registry-1.docker.io (OCI image index) for
# python:3.12-slim.
BASE_IMAGE = "python:3.12-slim"
BASE_IMAGE_DIGEST = "sha256:2c941e860699f878900b0edc2403613c234d4b32eda3cc9fa7036991a2a63c4a"
BASE_IMAGE_REF = f"{BASE_IMAGE}@{BASE_IMAGE_DIGEST}"

# --- apt pins -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY THE VERSIONS ARE SPELLED OUT
#   `apt-get install gfortran` resolves against the LIVE Debian archive, so the
#   same Dockerfile, from the same digest-pinned base, installs a different
#   compiler the week after Debian publishes one. The image digest pins the
#   filesystem you start from; it does nothing about what you then download
#   into it. For a tool whose whole claim is "the re-hosted numerics return the
#   same answers", the compiler is the single most consequential input, and it
#   was the one thing nothing pinned.
#
#   These are the candidates in the base image named by BASE_IMAGE_DIGEST
#   (Debian trixie), read from the image itself rather than from a changelog.
#
# WHEN A PIN GOES STALE
#   Debian drops superseded versions from the live mirror, so an old pin
#   eventually fails with "Version '...' for '...' was not found". That is the
#   intended behaviour: a loud failure you resolve deliberately, rather than a
#   silent toolchain change nobody reviewed. Refresh with:
#
#       nativegate toolchain --refresh
#
#   which reads the candidates out of the pinned base image and prints the
#   block to paste here. Update the base digest and these pins together, then
#   re-run the generated service's golden-value tests before shipping.
#
# WHY THE CONCRETE COMPILER PACKAGES ARE NAMED, NOT JUST `gfortran`
#   Pinning `gfortran=4:14.2.0-1` pins a METAPACKAGE. It exists to provide the
#   /usr/bin/gfortran symlink and to depend on the real compiler; the compiler
#   itself is `gfortran-14`, and apt only honours `=version` for packages named
#   on the command line. Measured in the built image:
#
#       gfortran       4:14.2.0-1     <- what the first version of this pinned
#       gfortran-14    14.2.0-19      <- the compiler that actually runs
#
#   Debian can ship gfortran-14 14.2.0-20 with the metapackage unchanged, and a
#   build that looked pinned would quietly change compilers. So the concrete
#   packages are named too. That hard-codes the GCC major version, which moves
#   with the Debian release — refresh it together with the base image digest.

# Extra pip-installed build tools, on top of `build`.
#
# WHY MESON IS NOT OPTIONAL FOR FORTRAN
#   The generated CMake runs `python -m numpy.f2py -c`. distutils was removed
#   in Python 3.12, so numpy's f2py falls back to its meson backend and shells
#   out to a `meson` executable. BASE_IMAGE is python:3.12-slim. Without this,
#   every generated Fortran image fails to build with
#   `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'meson'` — which
#   is exactly how CI found it, on the first run that ever executed.
#
#   Installed with pip rather than apt on purpose: Debian stable's `meson` is
#   older than what f2py's backend expects, and pinning the toolchain matters
#   more here than saving a layer. ninja comes along because meson drives it.

# diff in review.
#
# WHY --no-build-isolation, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE USUAL ADVICE
#   Two reasons, and the build failed on the first one.
#
#   1. It did not work. `pip wheel .` runs the backend in an isolated
#      environment, and f2py's meson backend then died with
#      `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mesonbuild'` — the `meson`
#      executable was on PATH from the layer above, but the module it needs
#      was not importable from inside the isolated build.
#
#   2. Isolation is itself a reproducibility hole. pip *downloads* the build
#      requirements into that environment at build time, unpinned — so the
#      scikit-build-core and numpy that compile the extension could differ
#      between two builds of the same pinned Dockerfile, which is exactly what
#      this whole exercise is closing. Installing them explicitly makes them
#      visible, and lockable.

# --- Crash containment (ROADMAP 2.2) --------------------------------------
#
# Legacy numerical code outside its validated envelope segfaults, calls
# Fortran STOP, or hangs. None of those raise a Python exception; the process
# simply dies or stops answering, and no `except` clause anywhere can see it.
# A bare `uvicorn` is ONE process, so any of the three took the whole service
# down and left nothing running to restart it.
#
# THE TOPOLOGY THAT SHIPS: a supervised worker pool.
#   gunicorn's master process supervises N uvicorn workers. A worker that
#   segfaults or STOPs is reaped and respawned; the master keeps the listening
#   socket, so the service never stops accepting. `--timeout 60` is the part
#   that covers HANGS: gunicorn kills a worker that has not completed its
#   request in time, which no amount of exception handling can do.
#   `--max-requests` recycles workers periodically, bounding the damage from
#   native code that leaks rather than crashes.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: per-request isolation. Requests sharing the crashed
#   worker die with it. Containing a crash to only the request that caused it
#   needs process-per-call, which puts marshalling cost on every request; that
#   is a separate, opt-in tier and is not implemented. Anything taking
#   untrusted input needs it — see docs/production-readiness.md.
#
# WHY THE FORTRAN DEFAULT IS ONE WORKER, AND IT IS NOT A THROUGHPUT OVERSIGHT
#   COMMON blocks are per-PROCESS storage. With one worker, a client's
#   `/pvt_set_fluid` and its follow-up `/solution_gor` at least reach the same
#   COMMON. With several, they can land on different processes and the compute
#   reads a COMMON that was never configured — turning an interleaving race
#   into a straightforwardly wrong answer. Raising WEB_CONCURRENCY is correct
#   ONLY for routines that carry no state across calls. gunicorn reads
#   WEB_CONCURRENCY itself, so this is an env change, not an image rebuild.
