    # a plain `function` like a scalar-only routine doesn't generate it, so
    # hardcoding it as a build output breaks for exactly that case. `f2py -c`
    # runs f2py's own build end-to-end and sidesteps this entirely.
    #
    # WHY `--backend meson` IS PASSED EXPLICITLY RATHER THAN LEFT TO DEFAULT
    #   f2py picks its backend from the Python version: meson on >=3.12 (where
    #   distutils is gone), distutils below that. Leaving it implicit means the
    #   generated service builds through two different toolchains depending on
    #   the interpreter, which is the opposite of what a re-hosting tool should
    #   promise — and the distutils path is actively broken, because
    #   `numpy.distutils` calls a `Compiler.__init__` signature that modern
    #   setuptools no longer has:
    #       TypeError: Compiler.__init__() takes from 1 to 3 positional
    #       arguments but 4 were given
    #   Reproduced on 3.11 + numpy 2.4 + setuptools 84: the default backend
    #   exits 1, `--backend meson` exits 0 and the extension computes. CI found
    #   it on macOS 3.10/3.11 while 3.12 passed, which is exactly the shape of
    #   a version-dependent backend.
    #
    #   numpy.distutils is deprecated and already unavailable on 3.12+, so this
    #   is the direction of travel regardless. meson + ninja are declared in the
    #   [build] extra and installed by the generated Dockerfile.
