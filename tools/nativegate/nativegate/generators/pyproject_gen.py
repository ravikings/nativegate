# gunicorn supervises the worker processes; see docker_gen's CMD and
# docs/deployment-topologies.md. It is a RUNTIME dependency, not a dev one:
# a bare `uvicorn` is a single process, so one segfault in native code takes
# the whole service down with nothing left to restart it.
#
# `uvicorn-worker` rather than `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`: the in-uvicorn
# worker class is deprecated and slated for removal, and shipping a deprecated
# import path inside generated code nobody is allowed to hand-edit is how a
# service breaks on a routine dependency bump.
#
# fastmcp is a RUNTIME dependency, not an optional extra: `service.py` imports
# mcp_server unconditionally, so a wheel without it does not start at all. The
# MCP endpoint is part of every generated service's surface by design — an
# LLM-callable interface that has to be switched on is one that is not there
# when someone goes looking for it. See generators/mcp_gen.py.

    `needs_numpy` is set for a C++ service that binds a raw `T*` as a numpy
    buffer: pybind11/numpy.h needs numpy's headers to build and numpy to
    import. A C++ service with no such pointer does not get the dependency —
    declaring it unconditionally would put numpy in every image for the
    benefit of the services that do not use it.

    `has_readme` is True when services/<name>/README.md exists on disk at
    generate time. The `[project] readme` field then carries it, because a
    wheel with no long_description is rejected by `twine check --strict`
    (the whole project builds with that gate on) and lands on PyPI's
    package page with the raw `text/x-rst` heading anyway. When the file
    does not exist the field must stay out: setuptools refuses to build a
    distribution whose declared readme is missing, and a service that has
    never had a README should still build.
