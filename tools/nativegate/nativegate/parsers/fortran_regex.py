"""Regex/line-oriented Fortran reader (design.md section 8).

This was nativegate's only Fortran front end; `fortran_fparser.py` is the real
parse tree that supersedes it, and `fortran.py` picks between them. It is kept
because it has no third-party dependency and because reproducing its exact
behaviour is how the fparser2 backend's parity is measured.

It does NOT scan the whole file into a tree. Each name in `expose.functions:`
drives one targeted regex search for that routine's
`function ... end function` / `subroutine ... end subroutine` block, and
everything else in the file is left untouched — so a 20,000-line template
with one exposed routine costs roughly the same as a 200-line one.

That property turns out to be a premature optimisation at the sizes nativegate
actually sees: fparser2 parses every deck in libraries/petro whole in well
under 0.15s each. It is documented here as a description of this reader, not
as a constraint on the replacement.

`expose.functions:` is still REQUIRED for Fortran (there is no
"expose everything" fallback like C++ has), under both backends.
