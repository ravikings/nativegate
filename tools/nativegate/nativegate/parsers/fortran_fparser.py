"""Fortran parser built on the fparser2 parse tree (design.md section 8).

This is the tree parser that supersedes `fortran_regex.py`. Both produce the
same `ir.ModuleIR`, so generators and the CLI do not care which one ran — see
`fortran.py` for the selection logic.

What a real parse tree buys, concretely — each of these is something the
regex reader reconstructs by pattern and can therefore get wrong:

* **Routine boundaries come from the grammar.** `Subroutine_Subprogram` /
  `Function_Subprogram` nodes have exact extents, so `end`, `end function`,
  `end function foo`, a bare F77 `END` and a nested `end do` are distinguished
  by the parser rather than by a regex that has to guess which `end` is which.
* **Continuations are gone before parsing starts.** Free-form `&` and
  fixed-form column-6 continuation are the reader's job in fparser, not a
  normalisation pass nativegate has to maintain in two dialect-specific copies.
* **Internal procedures are a separate node.** The declarations of a
  `contains`ed helper live in `Internal_Subprogram_Part`, not in the outer
  routine's `Specification_Part`, so a helper's `integer :: a` can no longer
  leak onto an outer dummy argument named `a`. The regex reader needed an
  explicit cut at `contains` to avoid exactly that.
* **Declaration attributes are structured.** `Intent_Attr_Spec`,
  `Dimension_Attr_Spec`, `Attr_Spec('OPTIONAL')` and per-entity array shapes
  are nodes, not substrings of an attribute blob.
* **Module nesting is structural.** The enclosing `Module` is found by walking
  up parents, so `end module` with the name omitted needs no special case.

What it still refuses to bind, deliberately (the same refusals the regex
reader makes, because they are f2py constraints and not parsing limits):

* derived-type (`type(...)`/`class(...)`) arguments and results,
* types with no entry in `ir.FORTRAN_TYPE_MAP`,
* under `implicit none`, an argument or result with no explicit declaration.

All of those are reported through `ModuleIR.skipped` — one unbindable routine
never costs you the rest of the file.

Two things this backend deliberately does NOT do differently yet, because
they are the next phase and changing them here would make parity
unmeasurable:

* **IMPLICIT typing** is still applied by `fixed_form.parse_implicit_map` /
  `implicit_type_of`. fparser2 does not apply implicit rules for you, and the
  rules are dialect-independent, so the statements are read off the tree and
  handed to the existing engine rather than duplicated.
* **F77 intent inference** still runs `fixed_form.infer_intents` over the
  normalised statement text. Rewriting that onto the tree is its own change
  with its own risk; until then the fixed-form path takes structure and types
  from the tree and intents from the existing inferencer, which is what keeps
  the two backends byte-identical on the legacy corpus.

Requires the `fparser` package (``pip install "nativegate[fparser]"``).
`is_available()` reports whether it imported; `fortran.py` falls back to the
regex reader when it did not.

    The cleaning rules live in `fixed_form` because the regex backend needs
    exactly the same ones — see `fixed_form.doc_comment_at`. What this
    function contributes is the part only a parse tree can give: the exact
    line span of the opening statement.

    fparser2 discards comments entirely unless the reader is built with
    `ignore_comments=False`, and `_parse` already does that — it has to,
    because `_subprogram_stmt` was written to skip the `Comment` nodes that
    retention introduces. So enabling comments cost nothing here and perturbed
    no existing walk; that bill was already paid.

    What is deliberately NOT used is the `Comment` nodes themselves. Measured
    on libraries/petro/fortran/pvtcor.f: the header sitting inside SUBROUTINE
    PVTINI is not a child of `Specification_Part` at all — fparser2 buries it
    inside an `Implicit_Part`, and where a comment lands depends on which
    grammar rule happened to be open when the reader reached it. Walking for
    that is a promise to re-learn fparser2's node placement every release.
    `item.span` is 1-based line numbers into exactly the text the reader
    consumed, which is stable, dialect-independent, and identical to what the
    regex backend can compute — so parity is free.

    `source` must therefore be the text that was parsed: on the fixed-form
