"""Hash-pinned dependency locks for a generated service.

WHAT THIS CLOSES

The generated Dockerfile installed the service wheel and let pip resolve
`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `gunicorn`, `numpy` and their transitive dependencies
from PyPI at build time, unpinned. So an image rebuilt a week later shipped
different Python code with no record of the change anywhere — the same hole
the base-image digest and the apt pins close on the other two layers.

`ngate lock <service>` resolves those dependencies once, records every
artifact's SHA-256, and the generated Dockerfile installs from the lock with
`--require-hashes`. After that, a rebuild either produces the same
dependencies or fails; it cannot quietly produce different ones.

WHY IT RESOLVES FOR THE IMAGE, NOT FOR THIS MACHINE

The lock is consumed inside `python:3.12-slim` on Linux. Resolving with the
local interpreter would pin macOS wheels, or wheels for whatever Python the
developer happens to run, and the build would fail — or worse, succeed with a
different set. Worse, pip evaluates environment markers with the interpreter
it runs under, and has no flag that overrides them: keyring declares
SecretStorage only for sys_platform == 'linux', so a lock resolved anywhere
else misses it, and the image's `--require-hashes` install fails. So the
resolution itself runs inside the pinned base image (`docker run`), where the
markers evaluate against the environment the lock is consumed in; the wheel
choice per architecture stays controlled by pip's --platform/--python-version
flags. Docker becomes a tool `ngate lock` requires, alongside pip.

BOTH ARCHITECTURES, IN ONE FILE

BASE_IMAGE is a multi-arch index that resolves on amd64 and arm64 alike, so a
lock naming only x86_64 wheels would break every arm64 build. Each dependency
is resolved for both platforms and the hashes are merged — `--require-hashes`
accepts several hashes for one requirement and matches whichever artifact it
actually downloads.

A package that resolves to *different versions* per architecture is refused
rather than silently locked to one of them: that is a genuine split in the
dependency graph, and picking a side for the user would produce an image whose
contents depend on where it was built.

    `platform` is every compatible tag for ONE architecture; pip takes the set
    and picks whichever a project publishes. The resolution runs inside the
    pinned base image via `docker run` — pip has no flag that overrides
    environment markers, which it evaluates with the interpreter it runs
    under. keyring for example declares SecretStorage only for
    sys_platform == 'linux': a lock resolved on a host of any other platform
    silently drops it, and the image's `--require-hashes` install then dies on
    the unpinned dependency. Inside the image, sys_platform, os_name and the
    interpreter version are the ones the lock is actually consumed against;
    the wheel choice itself stays under cross-environment control through
    --python-version and the --platform tag set.

    The container is left in the daemon's default architecture: it exists only
    to evaluate metadata, and the native wheel set for each architecture is
    selected by pip's own tag flags below, so a Rosetta-emulated run would buy
    nothing at measured cost.
