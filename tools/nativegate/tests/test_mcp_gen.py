"""The generated MCP server, exercised as a real FastMCP server.

The MCP endpoint is not a second implementation of anything: FastMCP derives
one tool per route from the router's OpenAPI schema, so the tool surface and
the HTTP surface are the same routes. That is the property worth pinning, and
it is only observable by actually building the server and listing its tools —
a substring check over the generated source would pass even if FastMCP named
every tool something useless.

Three failure modes here are silent rather than loud, which is why each gets
its own test:

* **tool names.** FastMCP names a tool after the route's OpenAPI operationId,
  and FastAPI's default is `<function>_<path>_<method>`. Without an explicit
  `operation_id=`, `solution_gor` reaches the model as
  `solution_gor_endpoint_solution_gor_post`. The tools still *work*; they are
  just much harder for a model to use, and nothing warns.
* **tool descriptions.** With no docstring on the endpoint, FastMCP falls back
  to a title-cased function name ("Solution Gor Endpoint"), which says nothing
  about what the routine does. Again: works, useless, silent.
* **the lifespan.** FastMCP's streamable-HTTP session manager starts in
  `mcp_app.lifespan`. Mounting the app without adopting it fails every tool
  call at REQUEST time, not at startup, so a service can boot clean and be
  broken. Verified here against the real generated `service.py` source.
