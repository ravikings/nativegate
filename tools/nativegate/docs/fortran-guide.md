# Exposing Fortran

Two dialects are supported, and the difference matters:

| | Free-form (`.f90`, `.f95`, `.f03`, `.f08`) | Fixed-form F77 (`.f`, `.for`, `.f77`) |
|---|---|---|
| Declarations | `real(8), intent(in) :: x` | often none — [IMPLICIT typing](#fixed-form-f77) |
| Routine end | `end function foo` | bare `END` |
| INCLUDE files | rare | common, and [f2py mishandles them](#the-include-trap) |

Uppercase suffixes (`.F90`, `.F`) mean the same dialect but run through the C
preprocessor first — see [Preprocessed Fortran](#preprocessed-fortran-f90-f-and-ifdef).

Jump to [Fixed-form F77](#fixed-form-f77) if you're working with legacy
`.f` sources.

## Designed for large legacy files

Fortran sources in this space — reservoir simulators, well-test templates,
other legacy oil & gas code — commonly run tens of thousands of lines with
hundreds of subroutines. nativegate's Fortran parser is built around the
common case of needing just one or two of those routines:

- `nativegate.yaml`'s `expose.functions:` list is **required** for Fortran
  (unlike C++, there is no "expose everything" fallback)
- only the routines you name are bound, however large the file is

How much of the file gets *read* depends on the backend. Under the regex
fallback, each requested name drives one **targeted search** for that
routine's `function ... end function` / `subroutine ... end subroutine` block
and the rest of the file is never parsed — so a 20,000-line template with one
exposed routine costs about the same as a 200-line file. The default fparser2
backend builds a parse tree of the whole file, which costs more on a huge
deck but buys grammar-accurate routine boundaries, structured attributes, and
derived-type support.

The targeted-extraction path is verified by
`tools/nativegate/tests/test_fortran_pipeline.py::test_extracts_one_routine_from_a_huge_file`,
which builds a synthetic 500-routine file and confirms only the target
routine is extracted.

```yaml
# nativegate.yaml
name: physics
language: fortran

expose:
  functions:
    - calculate_pressure   # only this routine is parsed, even in a huge file
```

A requested routine can live in any Fortran source under `native/` —
free-form `.f90`/`.f95`/`.f03`/`.f08`, fixed-form `.f`/`.for`/`.f77`, or the
preprocessed uppercase variants `.F90`/`.F` (searched via their expansions in
`native/_expanded/`). `generate` searches each file in turn until every
requested name is found, so you don't need to say which file it's in.

## What gets parsed per routine

For each exposed routine, nativegate extracts:

- parameter names, in declaration order
- parameter types, from `intent(in/out/inout) :: name` declarations, mapped
  via `ir.FORTRAN_TYPE_MAP` (`real(8)` → `float`, `integer` → `int`, ...)
- whether a parameter is an array (`dimension(...)` or `name(n)` syntax) —
  array parameters get NumPy handling in the generated service layer
- for `function`, the return type (from the `result(...)` variable's own
  declaration, or the function name's declaration if no explicit `result`)
- for `subroutine`, `is_subroutine=True` — no return value; results come
  back through `intent(out)`/`intent(inout)` array or scalar parameters

## The `module` wrapper gotcha

If your routines are wrapped in a Fortran `module` block:

```fortran
module physics
contains
    function calculate_pressure(density, temperature) result(p)
        ...
    end function calculate_pressure
end module physics
```

**f2py compiles this into a nested object**: the raw compiled extension
exposes `physics.physics.calculate_pressure`, not `physics.calculate_pressure`
at the top level. This is easy to miss and was caught during a real
`gfortran`/f2py compile, not by unit tests — the initial generator imported
at the wrong nesting level and would have failed at import time for every
module-wrapped Fortran service.

nativegate detects the enclosing `module` name during parsing
(`ModuleIR.fortran_module`) and bridges it in the generated `__init__.py` so
callers still get the flat interface design.md promises:

```python
# python/physics/__init__.py (generated)
from ._native import physics as _native

calculate_pressure = _native.physics.calculate_pressure
normalize = _native.physics.normalize

__all__ = ["calculate_pressure", "normalize"]
```

```python
from physics import calculate_pressure   # works — the nesting is hidden
```

If your Fortran source has **no** enclosing `module` (bare functions/
subroutines at file scope), f2py exposes them directly at the top level and
the generated `__init__.py` uses a plain `from ._native.<file> import ...`
instead — no bridging needed.

A service can't mix routines from two different Fortran modules; `generate`
raises a clear error if you try.

## What `generate` produces

```
CMakeLists.txt                 f2py-driven custom command + python_add_library(...)
native/_expanded/              INCLUDE- and cpp-expanded copies of the sources
                               actually handed to f2py, plus any `libraries:` decks
python/<name>/__init__.py      re-exports, bridged through fortran_module if needed
python/<name>/router.py        APIRouter with one POST per routine, GET /_unexposed,
                               and the process-wide native call lock
python/<name>/service.py       standalone FastAPI app, /healthz, exception handler
python/<name>/middleware.py    auth, rate limiting, body-size cap, /readyz, draining
tests/test_python_api.py       import + call smoke test (NumPy-aware for array params)
tests/test_golden.py           replays golden.json (skips until recorded)
pyproject.toml                 generated once, then yours
.nativegate/ir.json             machine-readable record of what bound
```

The endpoints live in `router.py`, not `service.py` — `service.py` is the thin
standalone app that mounts the router and adds `/healthz`. That split is what
lets the same router be mounted into a gateway.

**Every Fortran endpoint holds one process-wide lock across its native call**,
because COMMON blocks are process-global storage. This caps native execution
at one concurrent call per process, deliberately: without it, two requests
configuring different fluids interleave their writes into the same COMMON
block and each caller silently gets the other's numbers. Scale with processes,
not threads. See
[Architecture](architecture.md#the-concurrency-model-one-native-call-per-process-fortran).

## Verified against a real build

`services/petro_api/` — an F90 facade over the seven fixed-form F77 decks in
`libraries/petro/fortran/` — is compiled for real with `gfortran` + `f2py`,
imported through the generated package, and exercised through the generated
FastAPI service. Its `golden.json` pins 10 entry points, so a rebuild has to
reproduce the numbers, not merely compile. See
[Architecture](architecture.md#verified-not-just-tested).

## Fixed-form F77

Legacy `.f` sources are a different dialect, not just older syntax. nativegate
normalizes them before parsing: column-1 comments (`C`, `*`) stripped,
continuation lines (non-blank column 6) joined onto the statement they
continue, and columns 73+ discarded as punch-card sequence numbers.

### netlib dual-dialect sources (`CS`/`CD`)

Some netlib-era collections (specfun 2.5 is the canonical case) distribute
their sources with *every statement commented twice*, one copy per machine
precision, and ask the installer to comment one batch out by hand:

```fortran
CS    REAL FUNCTION GAMMA(X)
CD    DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION DGAMMA(X)
CS    REAL
CD    DOUBLE PRECISION
     1    C,CONV,EPS,...
```

That file is unreadable to every strict tool twice over: with neither
prefix commented, the grammar sees a floating continuation with no
statement (gfortran rejects it too), and the regex fallback finds no
routine because the FUNCTION lines carry the marking as well. Statement
labels are marked the same way (`CS900 GAMMA = RES` / `CD900 DGAMMA = ...`).

nativegate makes the choice static. Set

```yaml
# nativegate.yaml
dialect: cd
```

(or `--dialect cd` on quickstart / --dialect on inspect) and generate: the
`CD` half becomes live code in place, the `CS` half becomes a comment,
no column shifts anywhere, and the untouched netlib bytes stay under
`native/` — which is what `golden.json` hashes, so the transform never
infiltrates provenance. The resolved copy lives in `native/_expanded/`
next to the other generated transforms. Inspect a marked file without
committing to a dialect first with
`ngate inspect <file> --function DGAMMA --dialect cd`. Forgetting the
flag is caught: the failure says so and names the flag.

Accepted end to end by the [specfun-py](https://github.com/ravikings/specfun-py)
showcase: eleven upstream files, byte-identical to what netlib serves,
resolved in CI; the previously recorded golden tape comes back unchanged.

### IMPLICIT typing

F77 routines usually declare nothing about their arguments:

```fortran
      DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION PVTBUB (RSTGT)
      INCLUDE 'PETRO.INC'
```

`RSTGT` has no declaration anywhere. Its type comes from an IMPLICIT
statement — typically inside the INCLUDE file:

```fortran
      IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION (A-H,O-Z)
      IMPLICIT INTEGER (I-N)
```

so the **first letter of the name** decides the type. nativegate parses
IMPLICIT statements (including the FORTRAN default of I-N integer,
everything else real) and applies them to any undeclared parameter. Under
`IMPLICIT NONE`, an undeclared parameter raises an error instead of being
guessed.

This is not a nicety. Guessing `float` for `ICORR` would produce a binding
that compiles, imports, runs, and returns **wrong numbers**.

### The INCLUDE trap

f2py accepts an `--include-paths` flag and looks like it handles INCLUDE
files. It does not — for a routine with an INCLUDE **in its body**, the
wrapper it generates is silently broken: arguments never reach the Fortran
side. Measured against `libraries/petro`:

```
INCLUDE 'PETRO.INC' present      probe1(35.0) -> 1.09e-314   (uninitialized memory)
same IMPLICIT rules, no INCLUDE  probe1(35.0) -> 70.0        (correct)
INCLUDE expanded textually       probe1(35.0) -> 70.0        (correct)
```

No error, no warning — just garbage where your answer should be. So
nativegate expands INCLUDEs itself and hands f2py flat source, writing the
expanded copies to `services/<name>/native/_expanded/` (regenerated every
time; don't edit them).

Point it at your include directories:

```yaml
name: pvt
language: fortran
expose:
  functions:
    - PVTINI
    - PVTRS
include_paths:
  - libraries/petro/fortran/include
```

An INCLUDE that can't be resolved is an error naming the search path, not a
silent skip.

### Whole-file wrapping fails; per-routine works

f2py is also invoked with an `only: <routines> :` clause. For legacy F77
this is a **correctness** requirement, not an optimization — wrapping a
whole file pulls in routines whose PARAMETER-dimensioned arrays f2py emits
but never defines:

```
petromodule.c:932:16: error: use of undeclared identifier 'mxcell'
```

`matsol.f` fails to build whole-file and builds fine per-routine. This is
the same "name exactly what you expose" discipline the parser already
requires, now enforced through to the compiler.

### Output parameters (F77 has no `intent`)

Fixed-form F77 declares nothing about direction — every argument is
pass-by-reference and might be read, written, or both:

```fortran
      SUBROUTINE GASVIS (P, Z, VG)
```

`VG` is an output. Nothing in the signature says so.

f2py infers direction by analysing the routine body: a variable that is
assigned before being read becomes `intent(out)` and is **returned** rather
than passed in. Against `libraries/petro` this matched the decks' own
documentation exactly:

| Fortran | Generated Python |
|---|---|
| `SUBROUTINE GASVIS (P, Z, VG)` | `vg = GASVIS(p, z)` |
| `SUBROUTINE STEP (DTIN, DTOUT, ICONV)` | `dtout, iconv = STEP(dtin)` |
| `SUBROUTINE NODAL (..., QSOL, PWFSOL, ICONV)` | `qsol, pwfsol, iconv = NODAL(...)` |
| `SUBROUTINE THOMAS (A, B, C, D, X, N)` | `x = THOMAS(a, b, c, d, x, [n])` |

The generated FastAPI layer follows the same shape, returning the outputs as
JSON fields.

Two caveats worth knowing:

- **It is inference, not a declaration.** A routine that conditionally
  writes an argument, or writes it through a COMMON alias, can be classified
  wrongly. Check the generated signature (`help(ROUTINE)`) against the
  routine's own documentation before trusting it in production.
- **A modern F90 facade removes the guesswork.** If you can add one, a thin
  wrapper module with explicit `intent(in)` / `intent(out)` attributes makes
  the contract explicit instead of inferred —
  `libraries/petro/fortran/modern/petro_api.f90` is exactly this pattern.
  (`services/petro_api/native/petro_api.f90` is the service's own copy, and
  that is the one actually bound.)

### COMMON blocks mean the API is stateful

Legacy F77 passes state through COMMON blocks, not arguments. That survives
into Python as **module-level global state**:

```python
from pvt import PVTINI, PVTRS

PVTINI(35.0, 0.65, 180.0, 1)   # MUST be called first — sets COMMON
PVTRS(2000.0)                   # reads the COMMON set above
```

Call `PVTRS` without `PVTINI` and you get whatever was in COMMON before —
usually zeros, and `Rs = 0.0` looks like a plausible answer rather than an
error.

Two consequences worth taking seriously before putting this behind an HTTP
service:

- **It is not thread-safe or concurrency-safe.** Two requests configuring
  different fluids will corrupt each other, because they share one COMMON
  block in one process. The generated FastAPI layer does nothing to prevent
  this.
- **Initialization order is an undocumented API contract.** nativegate can't
  infer it — it comes from the original program's calling sequence.

For a real deployment, wrap the routines in a Python layer that enforces
init-before-use and serializes access (or runs one process per fluid
configuration). See
[Is this production-ready?](production-readiness.md).

### Verified against real code

`libraries/petro` (Peng-Robinson flash, PVT correlations, rel-perm, IMPES
solver — ~2,000 lines of 1988-1997 fixed-form F77) built through nativegate:

```
P=    500 psia   Rs=   79.85 scf/stb   Bo=1.0862 rb/stb
P=   1000 psia   Rs=  178.69 scf/stb   Bo=1.1261 rb/stb
P=   2000 psia   Rs=  405.73 scf/stb   Bo=1.2243 rb/stb
P=   3000 psia   Rs=  657.95 scf/stb   Bo=1.3416 rb/stb

PVTBUB(400) = 1976.225 psia -> PVTRS(pb) = 400.0000   (exact inverse)
```

and the `THOMAS` tridiagonal solver checked against NumPy:

```
max |THOMAS - numpy.linalg.solve| = 2.2e-16
```

### Preprocessed Fortran: `.F90`, `.F`, and `#ifdef`

An uppercase suffix means "run the C preprocessor first" — the file is not
Fortran yet, it is *input* to cpp. nativegate used to warn about these and then
read every `#ifdef` branch as simultaneously live, which silently binds
whichever branch happens to lex. Worse, `.F90` was not in the discovery table
at all, so a directory of preprocessed Fortran reported "No Fortran sources
found".

They are handled now: `generate` runs **gfortran's own preprocessor**
(`-cpp -E -P`) into `native/_expanded/` before anything parses, so discovery,
intent inference and f2py all see the code gfortran would have compiled.
gfortran's preprocessor rather than a bare `cpp`, because Fortran is not C — a
traditional cpp mangles `//` concatenation and fixed-form columns.

Which branch is live is the build's decision, so it comes from the config:

```yaml
fortran:
  defines:
    - DOUBLE_IT
```

Verified end to end: a `.F90` with an `#ifdef` generated, compiled through
f2py, and returned the configured branch's value. If gfortran is missing,
generation **stops with an error** rather than falling back to the old
misreading.

Two limits on where this expansion reaches:

- It runs in the `generate` path only. `inspect` and `suggest` do **not**
  preprocess, so an `#ifdef`-heavy `.F90` inspects differently from how it
  generates. Trust `generate`.
- It does **not** cover sources pulled in through `libraries:`. Those decks
  are copied and INCLUDE-expanded, but not cpp-expanded, so a library `.F`/
  `.F90` with live preprocessor branches is still read with every branch
  apparently active. Keep preprocessed sources in the service's own `native/`
  if the branch choice matters.

### Statement functions no longer widen intents

`DBL(X) = X*2.0*B` is a declaration wearing an assignment's clothes. The
intent inferencer used to count its right-hand side as a read, marking an
output like `B` as `intent(inout)` — never a wrong answer (widening keeps the
argument in the signature), but a signature demanding a value the routine
never consumes.

fparser2 is no help here — without a symbol table it classifies the line as a
plain assignment, same as a real array write (measured). The disambiguation is
semantic and exact: a *subscripted* assignment target that is never declared
as an array cannot be an array-element write, so it is a statement function.
Character substrings (`STR(1:3) = ...`) and dummy arguments are excluded, so
a real write is never skipped — skipping one would lose reads, and a lost
read can flip a genuinely-read argument to `intent(out)`, which f2py then
drops from the call.

The regex fallback backend keeps the old widening (safe, just noisier); the
fix rides the fparser2 default.

### Known limitation: source that doesn't compile

Two files in `libraries/petro` do not compile with modern `gfortran`, for
reasons that predate nativegate:

```fortran
      DIMENSION CP(MXBAND), DP(MXBAND)
      PARAMETER (MXBAND = 512)      ! declared *after* use
```

`gfortran -c matsol.f` fails on this directly. nativegate surfaces the
compiler error rather than working around it — fixing the source ordering
is the correct remedy.

### Sharing decks between services: `libraries:`

A facade usually calls into decks that are not its own. Name the library and
they are compiled into the extension:

```yaml
name: petro_api
language: fortran
libraries:
  - petro          # libraries/petro/**/*.f, plus any directory under it
                   # holding *.INC (here: libraries/petro/fortran/include/)
expose:
  functions:
    - solution_gor
```

This works differently from the C++ side, and the difference is not cosmetic.
C++ **links** a CMake target through `add_subdirectory`; `f2py -c` has no
target to link — it takes a list of sources and compiles them itself. So
nativegate copies the library's sources into `native/_expanded/` alongside the
service's own, expanding their INCLUDEs on the way, and hands the lot to f2py.

Three consequences worth knowing:

- **INCLUDE directories are discovered, not declared.** Any directory under a
  named library containing `*.INC` joins the search path. Explicit
  `include_paths:` still apply — these are added to them.
- **The original tree stays read-only**, as everywhere else in nativegate. What
  gets rewritten is the copy under `native/_expanded/`.
- **The Docker build context stays the service directory.** Everything the
  build needs has been copied under it, so unlike a C++ service with
  `libraries:`, you still build with `docker build -t petro_api:latest .` from
  `services/petro_api/`.

If the service has its own file with the same name as one in the library — the
usual case, where the F90 facade was copied in — the service's copy wins and
`generate` says so. Compiling both would be a duplicate-symbol link error.

#### What this fixed

`services/petro_api` bound its ten routines, produced an extension, and then
failed at import with `undefined symbol: iprvog_`: the seven F77 decks the
facade calls into were never compiled, because `libraries:` did nothing for
Fortran. The image now builds and runs, and every entry point returns its
recorded golden value exactly — including `tubing_bhp`, which is the one that
reaches `IPRVOG` in `wellib.f`.

### Derived types: flattened through a generated shim

f2py cannot pass a derived type — that has not changed. What changed: for a
module routine taking one, nativegate now generates a **Fortran shim** in the
`_expanded` copy that takes the components as ordinary scalars, builds the
type, calls the real routine, and copies output components back:

```fortran
type :: fluid_state
    real(dp) :: pressure
    real(dp) :: temperature
    integer  :: ncomp
end type

subroutine density(state, rho)          ! your routine, untouched
    type(fluid_state), intent(in) :: state
```

binds as `density(state_pressure, state_temperature, state_ncomp)` — the
published name is yours; the shim (`density_n2p`) is what f2py actually
wraps, and `intent(out)`/`inout` components come back in the response.
Verified by compiling the generated service and calling it.

The preconditions are narrow. Each is refused with its reason when unmet:

- **free-form source only** — the shim generator is not reachable from the
  fixed-form path, where a derived-type parameter is a hard error;
- **the fparser2 backend only** — under `NATIVEGATE_FORTRAN_PARSER=regex`,
  derived types are refused outright;
- the routine must be **inside the module that defines the type** (the shim
  constructs the type, and that is the only place it is visible from);
- the **type must be defined in the same file** as the routine, or its
  components cannot be read to flatten them;
- components must be **scalar numeric/logical** — arrays, CHARACTER and
  nested types don't flatten yet;
- subroutines only for now (wrap a function in one);
- non-derived companion arguments must be scalars.

Miss any of these and you get a refusal with the reason, not a wrong binding —
but do not plan on derived types as a general feature. Most legacy F77 will
not meet the first two conditions at all.

### CHARACTER outputs: fixed length binds, assumed length refuses loudly

Measured with numpy 2.5's f2py: `CHARACTER*32, intent(out)` builds and
returns the value — the old blanket "f2py cannot return a CHARACTER" threw
that away. It now binds, and the endpoint decodes the blank-padded bytes
f2py returns into a clean JSON string.

`CHARACTER*(*)` (assumed length) as an output is the dangerous one: it
**builds, imports, and silently returns an empty string** — measured, and
worse than a build failure. It stays demoted to an input, and the skip
message says to give it a length.

**This screening currently runs on the fixed-form F77 path only.** A free-form
`character(len=*), intent(out)` is not caught by it — it is bound with no
demotion and no warning, and will exhibit the empty-string behaviour. Declare
a fixed length in free-form source too; the tool will not remind you.

### Not yet supported

- `COMMON` blocks exposed as readable/writable Python attributes
- array / CHARACTER / nested components in derived types (scalars flatten)
